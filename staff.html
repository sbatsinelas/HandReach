    	<p class="text-left">
      	The late Brecken Chinn, Ph.D. is the Founder of HandReach. With an academic and professional career in communication, international affairs, and educational development, her dream was to bring the best hands in the world together to address the devastating loss of human capital caused by untreated trauma injuries. Dr. Chinn found her greatest inspiration in her adopted daughter Zhou Lin ("Jolene"), who at age 11 survived an explosion that nearly cost her legs and hands. Jolene, now an honors graduate of Dean College, has fully recovered and assists with HandReach's outreach, event planning, and international work, as well as serving on the Board.

			<h6><strong>Board Member</strong></h6>
			<p class="text-left">
				After earning a Bachelors degree in Management from Dean College, Jolene started working with Association of Air Medical Services and the MedEvac Foundation International in Administration, Finance, and Event Registration. She served as the original inspiration for HandReach to launch its Children's Healing Initiative and focus its mission on burn and trauma care through her inspiring journey of recovery from her own burn injury, which she sustained in a kerosene explosion at age 11, affecting the lower 55% of her body. Jolene has chosen to dedicate her volunteer efforts to HandReach through accounting and donor relations, hoping to enhance her ability to further nonprofit efforts benefiting other young burn survivors worldwide.

			<h6><strong>Research Coordinator</strong></h6>
			<p class="text-left">
				After graduating from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Political Science, George went to Japan for work as an English teacher, during which time he was hit by a drunk driver and his car engulfed in flames, resulting in months of burn treatment and reconstruction in Japan. George returned to the United States in 2006, and since 2007 has been a graduate student in Public Health at the University of Nevada. George says, "Having been through the process of surviving burns over 60 percent of my body, I can say that I am intimately familiar with the process of burn recovery, and that it is anything but easy. I'm happy to offer support, information, or help as I can to anyone who has been though a similar situation." George volunteers as HandReach's Research Coordinator, linking the organization with burn prevention and treatment efforts across the globe.
